# tsml-ui-starter-repository
## A starter repository for implementing the TSML UI

The purpose of this repository is to assist those without much experience with git and GitHub in setting up their own implementation of the TSML UI hosted via GitHub Pages.

Steps (can all be done within a web browser):
1. Create a GitHub account
2. Fork this repository
3. Edit the index.html in your forked repository to include your own site title, Google Sheet link (or link to custom JSON feed), Google Sheets API key*, Mapbox access token, and time zone.
4. Go to the settings of your forked repository -> pages -> select "main" for the branch
5. [Optional] [Add a custom domain](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)

*As an alternative to using a Google Sheets API key you can use the Code for Recovery [Sheets](https://sheets.code4recovery.org) tool.
